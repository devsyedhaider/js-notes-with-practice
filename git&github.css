/* ------------ Git Status

Git status is used to check the current state of my code if 
your code is same like github code he will show the msg your
branch is up to date with out branch name 

else you will change something our code he will msg for you like this .

example --- I will add a index,html file 

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        index.html


------------- Type of Status in git

There are four type of git status 

1 ) ---- Untrack

new files that git dosen't yet track , if you have to files first readme and second index.html you 
we commit the readme file but you will not commit the index.html file you will any change into boths file 
and we run the command ( git Status ) they will show the readme file is updated and orther one like index.html 
file is Untraked file because you will never commit on this html file .

2 ) ----- Modified 

You will change any thing in this file they will show you your file is modified .


3 ) ----- Staged

selected changes that are ready to be saved in the next Git commit.

Imagine you changed 3 files:

home.html

style.css

app.js

But you only want to save home.html and style.css.

You do:

git add home.html
git add style.css
git commit -m "Updated homepage UI"


4 ) ------ Unmodified 

You will not change in boths files .

*/

/*  ------------------ Git Add

git add is a command that moves your changed files into the staging area so they are ready to be saved in your next commit.

git add means “Select these files to save.”
git add moves your files from → Working Directory → Staging Area

----- 🎯 Why do we use git add?

Because Git does NOT save your files automatically.


------------------ 🧩 Example (Very Easy)

Imagine you changed two files:

1 ) --- home.html

2 ) --- style.css

Now you want to save only home.html.

So you do:

( git add home.html )

--------------- 🟢 Common git add commands

➤ 1. Add one file
git add index.html

➤ 2. Add all files
git add .

➤ 3. Add a specific folder
git add src/

➤ 4. Add specific file types
git add *.css



--------------------- Un Staged add file 

You will unstaged the specific file use this command .

----- Command. 

git rm --cached <file> file name

*/

/* 

----------------------- Git commit 

Commit the staged changes with a message

git commit -m "Your commit message"

You will check the lastest commands on the your team mate in our project .

/*

---------------------- Git Branch 

Git branch is used to separate code work so multiple developers can work without disturbing each other.


Step 1: Create branch
git branch feature-navbar

Step 2: Switch to your new branch
git checkout feature-navbar

----------- 🧠 Useful git branch commands

✔ 1. Show all branches
git branch

✔ 2. Create a new branch
git branch branchName

✔ 3. Switch to a branch
git checkout branchName

✔ 4. Create and switch together
git checkout -b branchName

✔ 5. Delete a branch
git branch -d branchName

✔ 6. Rename a branch
git branch -m oldName newName

✔ 6. Merge a branch
git merge branch name

/* ----------------------------- Git Ignore 

These files should NOT be tracked or pushed to GitHub.

But NO — Git tracks .gitignore normally.

Only the files INSIDE it are ignored.



------------ 🧪 Example in Simple Words

Imagine you have a school bag

Food

Waste items

So you tell someone:

“Don’t put these items in my bag!”

.gitignore does the same job for Git.

🔧 How to create .gitignore

Create file:
touch .gitignore


Add things you want to ignore:
node_modules/
*.log


Save and commit:
git add .gitignore
git commit -m "Added gitignore"


--------------------- Feature	Explanation 

.gitignore              -----    	Tells Git to ignore certain files
Purpose	                -----     Avoid pushing unwanted files
Common ignores	        -----     node_modules, .env, logs
Already tracked?	      -----     Use git rm --cached

*/

/* ----------------------------- Git stash 


git stash is a Git command used to save your uncommitted changes temporarily without committing them.

Git won't let you switch:

error: Your local changes would be overwritten
